// Thanks to karma-chai-plugins, those libs are exposed as global variables for convenience
// over typing several lines of boilerplate code at the beginning of each test.
// Also declare them into typescript.
// NOTE: using those globals is optional, a require() (+boilerplate) still work and will even give correct typings.

//declare const expect: any; // TODO
//declare const console: any; // TODO
